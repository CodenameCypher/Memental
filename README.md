# Memental

Tired of clicking through your courses in buX to find your deadlines? Afraid of missing the assessments because you missed the deadlines? Well, not anymore.

Get My Deadlines is a web application created using Python and Django framework, which collects all your deadlines from your buX account, and brings it all here in a more organised way. Now, you don't have to login to buX, browse through your courses to find your deadlines, Get My Deadlines will find your deadlines for you, and show it all here in a single page, so you don't miss the deadlines again!
